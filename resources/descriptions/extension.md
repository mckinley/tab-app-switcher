### Long Description

Tab Application Switcher (TAS)

It's like your system's Application Switcher, but for your Chrome tabs:
- Tabs can be accessed with intelligent and configurable keyboard shortcuts, very similar to your operating system's Application Switcher.
- Tabs are ordered by their last use. The last tab you used is the first tab to select.

Additional features to help you find and access your tabs:
- Tabs can be searched by url and page title.
- There is a full page Tab Manager that can be used as a New Tab page.
- Save collections of tabs in the tab manager, and reopen them later.

Default keyboard shortcuts:
- Hold alt and press tab to activate TAS.
- Continue holding alt, and press tab again to move forward through the list of tabs.
- Continue holding alt, and press ` to move backward through the list of tabs.
- Release alt to select the highlighted tab.

Additional commands:
- Use the up and down arrows to move through the list of tabs.
- Press enter to select the highlighted tab.
- Press esc to close TAS without making a selection.
