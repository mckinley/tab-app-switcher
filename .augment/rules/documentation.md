# Documentation Standards

## Code Comments

- Comments should be used sparingly. Code should be self documenting.
- Delete or revise comments as soon as they stop matching the code.
- Favor expressive tests over comments when explaining complex behavior.
- Before adding a comment, ensure that it is valuable information for a future developer.
- Never leave comments that describe or refer to a code change. Comments should only describe the current state of the codebase.

## Documentation Files

- Only `README.md` is allowed in the root directory. It is the canonical project documentation.
- Do not create new documentaion files unless explicitly asked.
- Add to the README only when information is critical for developers.
